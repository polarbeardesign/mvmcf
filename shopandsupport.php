    <p>Inspired by Nature, Jewelry by Heidi Gildred. As a jewelry designer, I'm inspired by the beauty of the world we live in, working with treasures from the sea and natural stones created within the earth upon which we exist. Every creation is unique and one of a kind.</p>

    <p>I believe in giving back to my community so 10% of all sales will be donated to the new Madison Valley Medical Center in Ennis, Montana. Although my heart is in Montana (where I live in the summer), my business is based in California, however I will pay the sales tax for you if I ship to this state.
