    <p>Our online store features gifts, art and more. A portion of the royalties from sales help carry out the Foundation's mission to support the health and well-being of people in Madison County and adjacent communities in southwest Montana.</p>

    <p>As an added thanks to our donors who provide these lovely items, we are including their contact information so you can learn more about their work and products. We hope that you will support their business and generosity to the Madison Valley Medical Center Foundation.</p>

        <p>Inspired by Nature, Jewelry by Heidi Gildred. As a jewelry designer, I'm inspired by the beauty of the world we live in, working with treasures from the sea and natural stones created within the earth upon which we exist. Every creation is unique and one of a kind.</p>
        <img src="photos/gewgawdesigns4.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 0 0.5em 0 0.5em"/>
        <p>I believe in giving back to my community so 10% of all sales will be donated to the new Madison Valley Medical Center in Ennis, Montana. Although my heart is in Montana (where I live in the summer), my business is based in California, however I will pay the sales tax for you if I ship to this state.
