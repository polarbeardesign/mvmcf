    <h1>Donor Recognition</h1>

    <h2>Every Gift is Special</h2>

    <p>We recognize our donors are special partners in the healing mission of the Madison Valley Medical Center Foundation. As an expression of gratitude, donors are recognized in the Foundation's Annual Report.</p>

    <p>A beautiful donor wall permanently recognizes cumulative gifts of more than $3,000,000 given for the Capital Campaign. That campaign raised funds for the current Medical Center facility - which opened it doors in March of 2009. The display is housed in the hospital lobby and stands as a symbol of caring and commitment.</p>

    <p>Many supporters have donated to rooms or departments of the Madison Valley Medical Center. The Foundation has recognized these donors with beautiful glass plaques, and named the departments after those donors.</p>

    <p>There are still a few naming recognition opportunities. For more information please contact the Foundation at (406) 682-6641.</p>
