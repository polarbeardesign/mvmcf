<h1>Foundation Dollars at Work</h1>

<p>Donations  to the Foundation are used to support and enhance patient care and to provide  needed services to the community. To keep pace with advancing technologies and  provide patients with the best diagnostic treatment services, the Medical Center must continue to replace  equipment, train staff and develop programs. The Foundation, on behalf of the Medical Center,  also takes seriously its obligation to the Madison Valley  community at large.</p>
