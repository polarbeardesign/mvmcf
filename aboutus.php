    <p>The Madison Valley Medical Center Foundation was established in 1988 to generate private financial support for the then Madison Valley Hospital &amp; Clinic. The Foundation is a non-profit corporation, governed by an independent board of directors that administers all philanthropic gifts to the Madison Valley Medical Center and its programs.</p>

    <p>In 2005, the Foundation began a Capital Campaign to generate financial support for the new facility which successfully opened its doors in March of 2009. Through philanthropic partnerships, the Madison Valley Medical Center Foundation strives to ensure that services and programs at the Medical Center will continue to meet the needs of the people living in the Madison Valley and southwestern Montana.</p>

    <p>The Foundation Board of Directors are volunteers who are dedicated to improving healthcare in our community. Without their efforts and compassion the MVMC Foundation would not exist.</p>
