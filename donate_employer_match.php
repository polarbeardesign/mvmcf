    <h1>Employer Match</h1>

    <p>Did you know that your donation to the Madison Valley Medical Center Foundation may be matched dollar-for-dollar? Your employer may multiply your donation's impact.</p>

    <p>Many employers have matching gift programs and will match tax-deductible charitable contributions made by their employees, retirees and employees' spouses. If you donate $100, for example, your company may contribute an additional $50 (50% match), $100 (100% match) or even $200 (200% match).</p>

    <p>To find out if your employer offers this incentive, please call the human resources department. Request a matching gift form, complete the employee portion of the form, and mail the form to the Madison Valley Medical Center Foundation with your gift. You may also want to ask your employer to start one.</p>

    <p>If your company requires more information about the Madison Valley Medical Center Foundation please use the information below to help complete your matching form request.</p>
